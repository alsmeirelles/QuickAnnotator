# Purpose
---
Machine learning approaches for segmentation of histologic primitives (e.g., cell nuclei) in digital 
pathology (DP) Whole Slide Images (WSI) require large numbers of exemplars. Unfortunately, annotating 
each object is laborious and often intractable even in moderately sized cohorts. 
The purpose of the quick annotator is to rapidly bootstrap annotation creation for digital
pathology projects by helping identify images and small regions.

Because the classifier is likely to struggle by intentionally focusing in these areas, 
less pixel level annotations are needed, which significantly improves the efficiency of the users.
Our approach involves updating a u-net model while the user provides annotations, so the model is
then in real time used to produce. This allows the user to either accept or modify regions of the 
prediction.

Requires:
1. Python 
2. pip
3. DADA source

And the following additional python package:
1. Flask_SQLAlchemy
2. scikit_image
3. scikit_learn
4. opencv_python_headless
5. scipy
6. requests
7. SQLAlchemy
8. torch
9. torchvision
10.Flask_Restless
11. numpy
12. Flask
13. umap_learn
14. Pillow

18. config
19. Tensorflow-gpu (for AL)
20. Pandas
21. TQDM
22. Imageio
23. Imagesize

# Installation
1. Checkout current repository
2. Checkout DADA AL from: https://github.com/alsmeirelles/DADA
3. Install requirements through requirements.txt file:
 You can likely install the python requirements using something like (note python 3+ requirement):
 ```
 pip3 install -r requirements.txt
 ```
4. Edit configuration file, as described bellow


*Note:* The *requirements.txt* under root directory of cuda version 11.

The library versions have been pegged to the current validated ones. 
Later versions are likely to work but may not allow for cross-site/version reproducibility

We received some feedback that users could installed *torch*. Here, we provide a detailed guide to install
*Torch*
### Torch's Installation
The general guides for installing Pytorch can be summarized as following:
1. Check your NVIDIA GPU Compute Capability @ *https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus* 
2. Download CUDA Toolkit @ *https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads* 
3. Install PyTorch command can be found @ *https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/* 

# Basic Usage
---
see [UserManual](https://github.com/choosehappy/QuickAnnotator/wiki/User-Manual) for a demo
### Run
```
 E:\Study\Research\QA\qqqqq\test1\quick_annotator>python QA.py
```
By default, it will start up on *localhost:5555*. Note that *5555* is the port number setting in [config.ini](https://github.com/choosehappy/QuickAnnotator/blob/main/config/config.ini#L6) and user should confirm {port number} is not pre-occupied by other users on the host. 

*Warning*: virtualenv will not work with paths that have spaces in them, so make sure the entire path to `env/` is free of spaces.
### Config Sections
There are many modular functions in QA whose behaviors could be adjusted by hyper-parameters. These hyper-parameters can 
be set in the *config.ini* file
- [common]
- [flask]
- [cuda]
- [sqlalchemy]
- [pooling]
- [train_ae]
- [train_tl]
- [make_patches]
- [make_embed]
- [get_prediction]
- [frontend]
- [superpixel]
